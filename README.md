**Generator** is a simple, lightweight and minimalistic random number
generation tool written in Python with the usage of Tkinter (GUI framework).
Generator is cross-platform and can work on many popular desktop platforms
like Windows and Linux.

Windows 7+ users can use the pre-built binary file (`generator.exe`)
which is available in the distribution of the application.

You can also execute the script file manually if you have Python 3 installed:

```
python generator.py
```

or, if you are working under Linux or some other UNIX-like OS:

```
chmod +x generator.py && ./generator.py
```

The executable file can be built for your platform by installing
PyInstaller module and executing `make.bat` (Windows)
or `make.sh` (UNIX-like OS) shell script. You can tweak these scripts
if you need.
